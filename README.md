Memetastic - Fetching and Displaying Memes

Memetastic is about fetching memes from the Imgflip API ("https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes") and displaying meme information, including the name, width, and height of each meme. 
This is achieved using asynchronous operations with promises and the Fetch API.
